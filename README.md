# hello-world
This is my first repository which I am creating so that I might understand how it works.

I have created this GitHub account for a Coursera course on R Programming which I am taking.  
I have taught statistics classes (intro stats, bio stats, and linear regression) but always used Minitab or
just TI calculators.  I am taking the course in R so that I have more options open to me.
